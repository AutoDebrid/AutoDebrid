# AutoDebrid üé¨

AutoDebrid is a slick automation tool that connects your Real-Debrid cache with JDownloader2 and Radarr. It automatically detects new movies added to your Real-Debrid account, sends them to JDownloader2 for download, and then adds them to your Radarr library for organization.

-----

## ‚ú® Features

  * **Automated Workflow**: Monitors your Real-Debrid account for new movie additions.
  * **JDownloader2 Integration**: Automatically sends download links to JDownloader2.
  * **Radarr Integration**: Adds downloaded movies to your Radarr library for renaming and organization.
  * **Web Interface**: A simple Flask-based web UI to trigger the process manually.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

The script works in a simple sequence:

1.  It fetches the list of recently added torrents from your Real-Debrid cache.
2.  It checks which of these are movies and not already in your Radarr library.
3.  It generates the direct download links for the new movies.
4.  Finally, it pushes these links to JDownloader2 to begin downloading.
